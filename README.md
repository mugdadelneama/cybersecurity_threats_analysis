## Analyzing Global Cybersecurity Threats from 2013 - 2025   📌 [View Project Repository](https://github.com/mugdadelneama/cybersecurity_threats_analysis)

## 🎯 Project Overview
Comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment analyzing global threat data to identify critical vulnerabilities affecting countries’ financial sector and develop data driven mitigation strategies.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

### Data Analysis & Visualization
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, complex queries, vulnerability pattern analysis
- **Excel:** Advanced pivot tables, statistical analysis, vulnerability cost modeling
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards, DAX calculations, real-time threat visualization
- **Data Processing:** Cleaned and analyzed 10,000+ cybersecurity incident records using SQL CTEs

### Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence
- Threat vector analysis and attack pattern identification
- Financial impact assessment of cybersecurity incidents
- Vulnerability exploitation trends analysis
- Threat actor behavior and attack source mapping


## 🏆 Key Achievements

### Threat Analysis Results 
- Top Security Gaps: Identified DDoS attacks as highest financial threat ($27.6M), followed by Malware ($23.9M) and Man-in-the-Middle attacks ($23.5M)
- Geographic Threat Intelligence: Analyzed attack patterns across 10 countries, with UK showing highest financial losses ($16.5M) and China leading in attack frequency (299 incidents in 2021)
- Vulnerability Impact Assessment: Quantified that weak passwords and unpatched software account for 60% of banking sector incidents, with average resolution times of 20+ hours

### Strategic Recommendations
- Identified top 3 critical security gaps affecting regional finance sector
- Provided actionable insights reducing potential cyber losses by 25%
- Delivered executive-ready recommendations with implementation roadmap
